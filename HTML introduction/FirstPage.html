    <!-- This is a paragraph where we can write a resume about ourself -->
    <p>The spirit of study and discover all that what have a relationship with electronics, computer and internet since my childhood. I started by learning the concepts of operating systems (DOS, UNIX) & how to Code the machine via c, python and deepthly with assembly, binary programming languages, without forget networking structures from local to internet networks The thing that drove me to chose the higher school of technology to study embedded systems as my first beginning to professionally after I passed my baccalaureate in science and technology in electricity.</p>
