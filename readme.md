### __The best way to learn Web developement__
For me the best way that's worked and when I started doing it that's help me to see some progress and I'm be able to develop some stuff from zero by the following :

* First I recommend to start with the basics and the fundamentals of everything that's this Documentation provide

* Don't try to remembre everything, just focus on understand the concepts and how to use the technologies 

 * Start building projects, That's the goal of writing this documentation, It's give you a amazing projects that's you can do with basic understanding that's makes you learn more and be able to build projects on your own
